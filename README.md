# Introduction to CLI and GitHub 
Introduction to CLI and GitHub for GRAD-MAP summer scholars 2025. 

## Background 
The terminal (aka command line interface) is where you can give instructions to tell your computer what to do. Before windows/menus/cursors/mice, it was all a user had to utilize a computer. Modern computers still work the same way behind the scenes, but also have the graphical user interface weâ€™re all used to. Terminal applications provide a place where you can access a more direct way of interacting with the computer. 


## Getting started
Open a new shell (Terminal on Macs, the Ubuntu24 we installed yesterday through WSL on Windows). When the shell is first opened you are presented with a **prompt**, indicating that the shell is waiting for input. The shell typically uses `$` as the prompt, but it may use a different symbol. The prompt is followed by a **text cursor**, a character that indicates where your typing will appear. The text in front of the prompt indicates the username, the computer you're running on, and the directory you're in. 

Let's get our bearings and try our first command. This command will print the current working directory you're in:
```
pwd
```
This will give you the full path of the directory you're in (which is sometimes shortened in the area before the prompt). If you're on Mac, this should look something like `/Users/YOUR-USERNAME`. If you're on WSL, it will look something like `/home/YOUR-USERNAME`.

Now that we have an idea of where we are, let's see if there is anything else in the directory we are in. To do this, we can use `ls` which is short for listing. This command list the contents of the current directory: 
```
ls
```
If you're on Mac, this command will list things like `Applications`, `Desktop`, `Documents`, `Downloads`, etc. In WSL, it's likely that you're home directory is currently empty, so this will show nothing and immediately jump to another prompt line. If you want to change your current directory to be able to access your `Desktop`, `Documents`, and `Downloads`, you can use the `cd` (change directory) command followed by the directory you want to change to. I *think* it will look something like 
```
cd /mnt/c/Users/$YOUR-WINDOWS-USERNAME
```

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories is called the **file system**. It organizes data into files and directories (aka folders), which can hold other files or other directories. 

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories. Directories are like *places* -- at any time while we are using the shell, we are in exactly one place (our current working directory). Commands typically read and write files in the current working directory. 

`ls` has lots of other options. Some options that are commonly used include:
* `-l` Selects the **l**ong output format (includes the file type, permissions, owning user/group, size, and last-modified timestamp)
* `-h` Output sizes as so-called **h**uman readable by using units of KB, MB, GB intead of bytes.
* `-t` Sort the list by modification **t**ime (default sort is alphabetically)
* `-c` Sort the list by last attribute (status) change time

We can also use `ls` to list the contents of a different directory
